Mini Project 1 - Creating and describing a Network for Cloud Computing

## Step by Step Config
- Objectives

The objective of this project was to create a sample Network that showed the AIMS/ISBA Lab and how it is connected to the Datacenter for the Business College

- Use Cases for This System

1) The first use case would be for a Network administator to better understand how everything is connected together between the lab and the datacenter if they have to troubleshoot or make a new addition to the system
2) The second use case would be that this system now has a design for a Network Administrator to recreate it. Should there be another lab (such as the bloomberg lab) they would be able to understand the necessary links quicker than if they did not have a framework
